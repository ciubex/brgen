This application will scan your contacts from phonebook for birthdays. You cand use this application to add and edit contact birthdays and to generate bithday reminders.<br/>
The application was tested only with google contacts and calendars.<br/>
The application is available on Google play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ro.ciubex.brgen <br/>
When is started the application is loading all your available contacts, but the birthways and images are loaded in background and appear when are loaded in this time thsi application could become lagging.<br/>
Generated birthdays reminders are stored on your selected calendar, for each contact with a generated reminder a green checkbox appear on the right.<br/>
Unfortunately the application "lose" the generated reminders when is reinstaled, but generated reminders remain stored on the calendar, that's because the contacts and reminders will have different ID's and can not be identified by this application, I did not find a way to do that. So, if the user chose to generate reminders, then new ones will be regenerated.<br/>
